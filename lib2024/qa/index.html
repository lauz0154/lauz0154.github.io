	<ol>
		<!-- Qus 1 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus: </strong>
				What are the three componets of Web?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans: </strong>
				Custom Elements, Shadow Dom, HTML templates.
		</p></li>
		<!-- Qus 2 -->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Define version control and give one example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				Version control is way of tracking or managing code, therefore people will be able to see the changes being made, It will also help manage the source code over time because of this. An example would be when using github, it tracks every single change made before, and after, the content is pushed to main.
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 3-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What tag is used to create the title of a web page? Give an example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The tag &lt;title>&lt;/title> is always used in the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tag to give the title to the html file/webpage. It will not appear on the website itself, but in the properties/in the url. An example would be when I titled assignment two for example, I used &lt;title&gt;Assignment 2&lt;/title&gt; to name the file, while also putting &lt;h1&gt;Assignment 2&lt;/h1&gt; in the body so it could be read there as well. 
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 4-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What tag is used to create a paragraph in html? Give an example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The tag for paragraph in html is &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;. It is used here in the qa file, but for a proper example:
				&lt;p&gt;This phrase is in a paragraph tag.&lt;/p&gt;
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 5-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Identify the odd one from these tags: <span>, <p>, <a>, <i>  and state the reason?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				I would say the &lt;i>&lt;/i> tag is the odd one out because it can add to any of the other 3 since it makes the texts in italics. &lt;span&gt;,&lt;p&gt;, and &lt;a> are all attributes needed to help create a code, while &lt;i&gt; is optional.
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 6-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What are the tags required to create a navigation list in HTML? 
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				If by navigation list you mean navigation bar, the following tags would be required to create it: &lt;nav&gt; for the container, &lt;ul&gt; and &lt;il&gt; to create the lists, and &lt;a&gt; for the links needed. &lt;ol&gt; might also be used in some circumstances.
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 7-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What element is used to create images? Name its attributes.  
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The element for images would be &lt;img src=""&gt;, where you would then enter the image url in the 'scr=' section. The attributes we learned in class are: &lt;alt&gt;, &lt;height&gt;, and &lt;width&gt;.
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 8-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Identify the odd one from these tags: <table>, <tr>, <b>, <td>  and state the reason
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The odd one out is the &lt;b&gt; tag. The &lt;b&gt; is an optional addition to add to text to make it bold, while &lt;table&gt;, &lt;tr&gt;, and &lt;td&gt; are all tags that help in creating a table in html coding. All three are needed to create a table, while &lt;b&gt; is not necessary to use when creating one. 
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 9-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Give an example of a colour picker input.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The tag to be used would be &lt;input type="color" name="#000000"&gt;. The name would be the hex code value for the colour wanted, which will be 7 numbers long. When in a pproper coding file, it could let the user choose from a colour wheel, or to input the  hex code for the colour they want. If they wanted red, the hex code would be #ff0000.
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 10-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				What is the use of name and value attributes? Give two examples.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				The value attribute is used to specify a particular element. For example, if using the &lt;progress> element tag, the value will be used to determine the current progress out of the max attribute also attached to it. So it would be &lt;progress value="38" max="100"&gt;. The name attribute is used to specify the name of an element tag. A great example would be when using meta tags, it helps identify each meta with a name, so a tag would look like: &lt;meta name="keywords" content="HTML, HTML5"&gt;. For the meta tag, the name attribute would be followed by the content attribute. 
			</p>

		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Give an example of an inline style?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				An inline style is related to CSS. It can be used by using the style attribute to existing HTML elements. An example would be &lt;h1 style="color:blueviolet;"&gt;Example&lt;/h1&gt;
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 12-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				How would you link an external style sheet? Give an example.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				To link an extermal style sheet, one would first have to have CSS file to link it to the HTML file. To link it, it would have to be located in the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags. The to link it, it would be &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/style.css"&gt;
			</p>
		</li>
		<!--Qus 13-->
		<li>
			<p>
				<strong>Qus:</strong>

				.center {
					height: 200px;
					width: 200px;
					position: absolute;
					left: 50%;
					margin-left: -50px;
					top: 50%;
					margin-top; -50px;

				.rotate-me {
					width: 300px;
					height: 300px;
					animation-name: spin;
					animation-duration: 0.5s
					animation-iteration-count: 5;
					animation-timing-function: linear;

				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				How would you select all elements with class "my-class" using Javascript and JQuery?

				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Give an example of input field that takes phone number with format "123-456-7890"?
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				If we are talking about html, the tags used would be &lt;label for="phone"&gt;&lt;/label&gt; and &lt;input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern="[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}" required&gt;. &lt;small&gt;format: 123-456-7890&lt;/small&gt;. For it to be for that format, it would be included in the pattern attribute.

				<strong>Qus:</strong>
				Among HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, what language did you like the best? State the reason.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Ans:</strong>
				Amongst all four of these languages, I definelty have to say that HTML was my favourite. It was easy to understand, and it's actually quite fun to play around with, especially when creating forms. The coding for html itself is also very satisfying to look at. It was easier learning than I originally thought, and it's rather easy to get the hang of the basics. Overall, html was very enjoyable to learn.
